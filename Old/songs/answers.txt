1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would
    you characterize their audio aura?

Answer: This listener seems to select for songs with above average energy and
    danceability, but average valence. It seems as though they're most interested
    in music with some energy and excitement but not necessarily something very
    upbeat. Sumarizing this to one value, this listener's aura would be
    mildly Purple

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not
    be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating
    this aura would you propose?

Answer: The first issue with a singular Aura is that people change throughout
    the day, week, month, and year. It would be more effective use of a full
    year's worth of data to calculate the, lets say, top 3 or 5 most coherent
    auras. Spotify could go further and anticipate those auras by maping them
    against times of the year or month.
