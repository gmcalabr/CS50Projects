sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: Extremely fast with already sorted data, omega(n). Much slower with random or reversed data, O(n^2).

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: Virtually uneffected by data order, so O() and omega() are the same. Not much slower with very large sets, so much faster than O(n^2). Fastest sort overall.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: Mostly uneffected by data order. O(n^2) and omega(n^2). Exponentially slower for larger data size. Faster than Sort1 in most cases.
